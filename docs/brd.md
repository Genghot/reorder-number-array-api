# Business Requirement Document for "Reorder Number in Array API"

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing an API that allows users to reorder numbers in an array.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this API is to provide a service that accepts an array of numbers and returns a reordered array based on specified criteria.

## 3. Scope
The API will support the following features:
- Accept an array of integers
- Reorder the array in ascending or descending order
- Return the reordered array to the client

## 4. Stakeholders
- Product Manager
- Development Team
- Quality Assurance Team
- End Users

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: The API must accept an HTTP POST request.
- **FR2**: The request body must contain a JSON object with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "order": "ascending" or "descending"
  }
  ```
- **FR3**: The API must validate the input array to ensure it contains only integers.
- **FR4**: The API must support the following order options:
  - "ascending": Sorts the array from smallest to largest.
  - "descending": Sorts the array from largest to smallest.
- **FR5**: The API must return a JSON object with the reordered array:
  ```json
  {
    "sorted_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]
  }
  ```

### 5.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: The API response time must be under 200ms.
- **NFR2**: The API must handle up to 1000 concurrent requests.
- **NFR3**: The API must adhere to RESTful architecture principles.
- **NFR4**: The API must be documented using Swagger.

## 6. Swagger Documentation
The API will be documented using Swagger to provide interactive API documentation. The following endpoints will be included:
- POST `/reorder`
  - Request Body:
    - `numbers`: An array of integers
    - `order`: String ("ascending" or "descending")
  - Response:
    - `sorted_numbers`: An array of reordered integers

## 7. Assumptions
- The API will be deployed on a cloud server.
- The client will handle input validation before sending requests to the API.

## 8. Timeline
- Development Start Date: [Insert Date]
- Development End Date: [Insert Date]
- Testing Period: [Insert Date]
- API Launch Date: [Insert Date]

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- The API must pass all test cases defined in the testing phase.
- The API must provide a successful response for valid input and appropriate error messages for invalid input.
- Swagger documentation must be complete and accessible.

## 10. Conclusion
This document serves as a guideline for the development of the Reorder Number in Array API, detailing the essential functionalities and requirements necessary for project success.

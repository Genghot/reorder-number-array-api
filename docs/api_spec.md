# API Specification for "Reorder Number in Array API"

## Overview
This API allows users to reorder an array of integers based on specified sorting criteria. It accepts input through a POST request and returns a JSON object containing the reordered array.

## API Endpoint
### POST `/reorder`
- **Description**: Reorders an array of integers based on the specified order.
  
## Request
### Headers
- **Content-Type**: application/json

### Request Body
The request must contain a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "order": "ascending" or "descending"
}
```

### Parameters
- **`numbers`**: (Array of integers) The array of integers to be reordered. Must only contain integers.
- **`order`**: (String) Required. Specifies the order in which to sort the numbers. Accepts "ascending" or "descending".

### Example Request
```http
POST /reorder HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "numbers": [4, 2, 3, 1],
  "order": "ascending"
}
```

## Response
### Response Body
The API will respond with a JSON object containing the reordered array:

```json
{
  "sorted_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

### Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Successfully reordered the numbers.
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input, such as a non-integer in the array or an unknown order type.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

### Example Response
For a successful request:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sorted_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

For an invalid request:
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Input must be an array of integers and a valid order."
}
```

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The response time must be under 200ms.
- **Scalability**: The API must handle up to 1000 concurrent requests.
- **Architecture**: The API must adhere to RESTful principles.
- **Documentation**: API documentation must be generated using Swagger.

## Implementation Notes
- Input validation should be performed to ensure that the `numbers` array only contains integers and that the `order` is either "ascending" or "descending".
- Provide appropriate error handling to return meaningful error messages for bad requests.

## Swagger Documentation
The API will have interactive documentation generated by Swagger, including endpoints, request/response examples, and error messages. 

## Conclusion
This specification outlines the required functionality and constraints for the Reorder Number in Array API, ensuring it meets user needs and performs efficiently under expected load conditions.
